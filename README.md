# Voice-assitant-using-python
I am developing a Python-based voice assistant, employing libraries for speech recognition, like SpeechRecognition with PyAudio, and utilizing gTTS for text-to-speech conversion. The assistant will support personalized interactions, context awareness, and seamless integration with external APIs for real-time data updates.
